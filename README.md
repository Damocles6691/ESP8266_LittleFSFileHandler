# ESP8266_LittleFSFileHandler
A very Little Libary to create and use JSON Config(s)

Ver. Beta - 0.2

This Libary is an Upgrade for B0.1 - both versions are compatible to each other but this Libary uses the "original" LittleFS libary not the Class out of Arduino Core (can be found here: https://github.com/ARMmbed/littlefs) - this is part of Arduino to b

Req. 
  - ArduinoJSON (tested with: version 6.15.2)
  - LittleFS (part of Arduino Core)
  
 Useable like POSIX or Unix Commandline (e.g move, mkdir, etc.) - more soon...
